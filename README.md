# Story Creator

Hi :)

Simply put, this is pretty much the same thing as [Anecdote Creator](https://github.com/StanGraafmans/AnecdoteCreator) but written in C# and outputting in English. It's a small console application that generates and outputs a random sentence by throwing together a random pick of words. I put it on here because it seems to get a laugh or two out of most people.

## Getting Started

### How To Run
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/StanGraafmans/StoryCreator/releases/latest)'s .zip file
2. Extract it
3. Double click on StoryCreator.exe

### Usage Guide
Press any key to generate the next sentence. If you wish to add to/remove from/edit the lists of elements that the generator uses, simply:
1. Open one of the .txt files in the 'res' folder
2. Change it to your liking
3. Save it
4. Restart the .exe file

Have fun!
