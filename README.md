# Story Creator

Hi there, reader! Simply put, this is pretty much the same thing as [Anecdote Creator](https://github.com/StanGraafmans/AnecdoteCreator) but written in C# and outputting in English. It's is a small console application that generates and outputs a random sentence by throwing together a random pick of words. I put it on here because it seems to get a laugh or two out of most people.

## How To Run
1. Download the latest release's .zip file
2. Extract it
3. Double click on StoryCreator.exe

### How To Use
Press any key to generate the next sentence. If you wish to add/remove/edit the lists of elements that the generator uses, simply open one of the .txt files with suffix "_list" and change it to your liking.

Have fun!
